<h1>Welcome to the official <strong>Asleep In The Weeds</strong> fan page!</h1>
<p>A local Charlotte experimental jazz/funk/rock/circus group which is the creation of lead guitarist, and composer, Chad Thompson. The band developed from a Duo of Mr. Thompson and Matt Daul on Drums. Eventually it found its full form with the addition of several more very talented and seasoned musicians to create a unique orchestral combination. Their first full length album was recorded here in Charlotte just 5 years ago, and only a few have been fortunate enough to hear it!</p>
